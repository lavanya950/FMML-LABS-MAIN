        "### Questions to Think About and Answer\n",
        "1. Why does the TF-IDF approach generally result in a better accuracy than Bag-of-Words ?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)** approach generally results in better accuracy than the **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** model because of the following key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Handles Word Frequency Differently**\n",
        "   - **Bag-of-Words** simply counts how many times a word appears in a document. While this gives a basic idea of word presence, it does not account for the relative importance of words in the corpus. Words that occur frequently in most documents (e.g., common words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\") are given the same weight as more informative words, which could lead to poor performance in text classification tasks.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **TF-IDF**, on the other hand, adjusts the frequency of words by considering not only how often a word appears in a particular document (Term Frequency, TF), but also how often the word appears across all documents in the corpus (Inverse Document Frequency, IDF). This helps **downweight common words** and **highlight more informative words** that are unique to certain documents, improving the representation of the documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Reduces the Influence of Common Words**\n",
        "   - **Problem with Bag-of-Words**: In BoW, the most common words across all documents (often stopwords like \"is\", \"the\", \"on\", etc.) can dominate the feature set. These words are not very informative for distinguishing between classes, but because they appear frequently in many documents, they can overwhelm the analysis and skew the model.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **TF-IDF Advantage**: TF-IDF reduces the weight of words that appear frequently across many documents (which are likely less informative), and **increases the weight** of words that are specific to a smaller subset of documents (which are more informative and relevant). The IDF component helps to give more importance to rare terms, leading to a better feature representation for classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Improves Document Representation**\n",
        "   - **BoW**: Treats words independently and assigns them the same weight, ignoring the context in which words appear. This leads to a **sparse** representation of the text, with many features representing common words.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **TF-IDF**: By down-weighting frequent terms and emphasizing less common, more distinctive terms, TF-IDF provides a **more nuanced representation** of the text. It captures the relative importance of each term within the document and the corpus, making it better suited for distinguishing between different documents or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Better Differentiation Between Documents**\n",
        "   - **BoW** may struggle to distinguish documents when they share a lot of common words. This is because the frequency of those common words is treated equally across all documents.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **TF-IDF** improves the ability to differentiate documents because it gives more weight to words that are unique to certain documents. For example, if two documents share a common theme but use different specialized vocabulary, TF-IDF will help distinguish them better because it emphasizes the unique words in each document, rather than just counting all words equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Helps in Reducing Dimensionality**\n",
        "   - **Problem with BoW**: The BoW approach can lead to very high-dimensional feature vectors, especially when there is a large vocabulary. Many of these dimensions may correspond to common words that don't provide useful information.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **TF-IDF's Effect**: Since the IDF part of TF-IDF down-weights common words, it **reduces the number of significant features**. This can result in a **denser, lower-dimensional feature space** that is more useful for machine learning algorithms, reducing the computational complexity and improving model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Improves Accuracy by Giving Contextual Weight to Words**\n",
        "   - In the BoW model, each word is treated as an independent feature, without consideration for how its frequency compares across the entire corpus. This can lead to inaccurate representations for words that may appear frequently in one document but are generally not important in distinguishing different classes.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - With TF-IDF, the **importance of a word is measured** by both how frequently it appears in the document and how rare it is in the corpus. This helps **emphasize important terms** that can more effectively distinguish between documents or classes, leading to better classification accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "Let’s consider a document classification task where we are classifying movie reviews as either \"positive\" or \"negative\". Common words like \"movie\", \"film\", \"actor\", etc., appear in most reviews regardless of sentiment. If we use **Bag-of-Words**, these common words could dominate the feature vector and reduce the impact of sentiment-bearing words like \"great\", \"boring\", \"exciting\", etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in **TF-IDF**, these common words will be down-weighted (because they appear in many reviews), and sentiment-heavy words will receive higher weights. This better reflects the **unique aspects** of each document and helps improve the classifier's performance.\n",

        "### **Conclusion:**\n",
        "TF-IDF generally leads to **better accuracy** than Bag-of-Words because it emphasizes important, distinctive terms while reducing the impact of frequent, less informative words.

These embeddings are trained in such a way that words with similar meanings appear closer in the vector space.\n",
        "     - **Word2Vec**: Uses models like **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** or **Skip-gram** to learn vector representations of words by predicting surrounding words or being predicted by surrounding words.\n",

LSA attempts to uncover latent structures or relationships between terms in a corpus by projecting words and documents into a reduced vector space. The goal is to capture hidden **semantic** relationships between words by considering the context in which they appear.\n",

        "3. Read about Stemming and Lemmatization from the resources given below. Think about the pros/cons of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stemming** and **Lemmatization** are two common techniques used in natural language processing (NLP) to reduce words to their base or root forms. Both methods help to normalize words, making them easier to analyze by reducing inflected words or words with derivational affixes to a common root form. However, they operate differently, and each has its own pros and cons depending on the context in which they are used. Let’s break down both techniques and evaluate their advantages and disadvantages.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Stemming**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Stemming** is the process of reducing a word to its root form by removing prefixes and suffixes. This is done through simple algorithms (such as **Porter Stemmer**, **Lancaster Stemmer**, or **Snowball Stemmer**) that apply heuristic rules to remove suffixes from words, often without regard for whether the result is a valid word.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
        "  - \"happiness\" → \"happi\"\n",
        "  - \"better\" → \"better\" (though this word might remain unchanged depending on the stemmer)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Stemming**:\n",
        "1. **Speed**: Stemming algorithms are generally faster than lemmatization because they apply simple, rule-based heuristics without the need for a dictionary lookup or part-of-speech tagging.\n",
        "2. **Simplicity**: Stemming is conceptually simpler. You don’t need complex resources like dictionaries or word mappings; a stemmer just cuts off common affixes (like “-ing,” “-ly,” “-ed”).\n",
        "3. **Less Memory Intensive**: Since no dictionary or lexicon is required, stemming is less resource-intensive than lemmatization.\n",
        "4. **Good for Large Datasets**: Stemming is particularly useful when working with large text corpora where speed and simplicity are paramount.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cons of Stemming**:\n",
        "1. **Inaccuracy**: The biggest drawback of stemming is that it can sometimes produce **non-words** or **incorrect stems** that don’t exist in the dictionary, such as \"happi\" instead of \"happy\" or \"runn\" instead of \"run\".\n",
        "2. **Loss of Meaning**: Stemming doesn’t account for the correct meaning of a word in context. For example, it can reduce \"better\" to \"better,\" but in some cases, the meaning might change with lemmatization (e.g., \"good\" becomes \"better\").\n",
        "3. **Over-Stemming/Under-Stemming**: Sometimes a stemmer might over-reduce words (e.g., \"better\" → \"bet\" or \"running\" → \"run\"), or it might not reduce words enough (e.g., \"studies\" → \"studi\" instead of \"study\").\n",
        "4. **Context Ignorance**: Since stemming algorithms don’t consider context, they might reduce words incorrectly. For example, “organization” might be stemmed to \"organ,\" which loses the meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Lemmatization**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lemmatization** is a more sophisticated technique that aims to reduce a word to its **dictionary form**, known as the **lemma**. Lemmatization involves using vocabulary and grammar rules, often with the help of a **part-of-speech (POS) tagger** to determine the word's correct lemma. For example, \"better\" might be reduced to \"good\" (as it’s an adjective), while \"running\" is reduced to \"run\" (as a verb).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Example**:\n",
        "  - \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
        "  - \"happiness\" → \"happy\"\n",
        "  - \"better\" → \"good\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Lemmatization**:\n",
        "1. **Accuracy**: Lemmatization is **context-sensitive**, and it ensures that words are reduced to their correct dictionary form. For example, \"better\" becomes \"good,\" and \"running\" becomes \"run.\" This reduces the likelihood of creating **non-words** or reducing words incorrectly.\n",
        "2. **Preserves Meaning**: Since lemmatization uses a dictionary and part-of-speech information, it can better preserve the **meaning** of words. For instance, it can differentiate between \"run\" as a verb (to move fast) and \"run\" as a noun (an event).\n",
        "3. **More Natural**: The results of lemmatization are usually **real words**, and the text remains grammatically sound, which is useful for tasks like text generation or when the goal is to maintain linguistic accuracy.\n",
        "4. **Improves Accuracy in Downstream Tasks**: Lemmatization is generally better when working with models that rely on precise and well-formed inputs, such as **named entity recognition (NER)**, **information retrieval (IR)**, and **machine translation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cons of Lemmatization**:\n",
        "1. **Slower**: Lemmatization is more computationally expensive than stemming, as it involves accessing a dictionary or lexicon and performing part-of-speech tagging. This can lead to slower processing times, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "2. **Requires More Resources**: Lemmatization requires access to **wordnet** or similar lexicons and may need additional resources like POS taggers. It is more resource-intensive than stemming, both in terms of memory and processing power.\n",
        "3. **Complexity**: Lemmatization is more complex than stemming, as it requires context and additional linguistic knowledge to determine the correct lemma. This means that lemmatization tools are more complicated to implement or use compared to stemmers.\n",
        "4. **Possible Errors in POS Tagging**: If the part-of-speech tagger used for lemmatization makes a mistake (for example, mistaking a noun for a verb), the lemma might be incorrect, which could lead to errors in the final results.\n",
